The results from the simulations shown in Section~\ref{sec:Simulations} show that the camera
operates according to the desired behaviour described in Section~\ref{sec:AnalogDesign}~and~\ref{sec:DigitalDesign}.

It does however demonstrates a big weakness in that the amount of ADCs required scales with
the square root of the number of pixels, a different design could easily yield either
lower productioncost or shorter time between pictures.
Other than that future improvements to this particular project would probably focus on fine tuning and scaling.

Since the analog design in Appendix~\ref{ap:SpiceCode} is written modularly, a natural continuation of the project would be to enable color as well as increase the resolution.
The project would allso benefit from a more scalable and maintanable rewrite of the digital design in Appendix~\ref{ap:VerilogCode}.
