\subsection{Analog simulations}

All simulations of the analog circuitry were done using the AimSpice SPICE backend~\cite{AIMSpice} along with the AIMPlot~\cite{aimplot} frontend.


\subsection{Digital simulations}

All simulation of the digital control system were run using SystemVerilog testbenches in icarus~verilog~\cite{icarusVL} and shown in GTKWave~\cite{gtkwave}.
