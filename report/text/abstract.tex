% This file contains the summary of the report.

This report describes a design of a 4 pixel digital camera.
It includes an analog schematics for all the pixels as well as a digital design for the control unit.
Coupled with a pulse shaper and the square root of the number of pixels ADCs this design can be adapted to an arbitrary
quadratic digital camera.

The report concists of a summary of the necessary theory, a description of the design as well as simulations.
