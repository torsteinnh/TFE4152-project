This project has shown that dividing the camera into separate analog and digital parts is a good and efficient way of developing a design.
It has allso been shown that a simple 4-pixel black and white camera can be implemented following this method.

The project has also developed many of the necessary buildingblocks for designing more complex
digital cameras.
