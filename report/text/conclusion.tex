This project has shown that dividing the camera into separate analog and digital parts is a good way of achieving an efficient and lean solution.
It has allso been shown that a simple 4-pixel black and white camera can be implemented following this method.

Since the analog design in Appendix~\ref{ap:SpiceCode} is written modularly, a natural continuation of the project would be to enable color as well as increase the resolution.
The project would allso benefit from a more scalable and maintanable rewrite of the digital design in Appendix~\ref{ap:VerilogCode}.
