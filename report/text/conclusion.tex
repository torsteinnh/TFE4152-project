Dividing a digital camera into an analog part and an digital part seems to be a good way of doing this, and done correctly, can lead to an efficient and lean solution. 

By simulating the analog part as a subset of the digital control FSM, a fully simulated 4-pixel camera was simulated and realized. 

To be timed correctly, one extra clock rise edge was added to
